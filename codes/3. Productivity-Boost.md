## Context in CLI for Microsoft 365

Imagine the following script segment which you have

```bash

# Getting the list of SharePoint Lists in site
m365 spo list list --webUrl https://menon365.sharepoint.com/sites/WorkRnD

# Getting the List details
m365 spo list get --webUrl https://menon365.sharepoint.com/sites/WorkRnD  --title "Column Formatting RnD"

# Enable versioning for your list
m365 spo list set --webUrl https://menon365.sharepoint.com/sites/WorkRnD --title "Column Formatting RnD" --enableVersioning true --majorVersionLimit 50

# Get list of List items

```

How about we have something called context in CLI for Microsoft 365. So that you can set the context to a site and then run the commands without specifying the Parameters again and again.

```bash
# Setting WebURL
m365 context option set --name 'webUrl' --value "https://menon365.sharepoint.com/sites/WorkRnD"
# Setting List Name
m365 context option set --name 'title' --value "Column Formatting RnD"

# Getting the List details
m365 spo list list

# Getting the List details
m365 spo list get

# Enable versioning for your list
m365 spo list set --enableVersioning true --majorVersionLimit 50

```

## Saving Entra ID Apps and usage of then same in your application

Imagine you have a script which creates an Entra ID App and then you want to use the same in your application. You can save the output of the command to a file and then use the same in your application.

```bash

m365 entra app get --name 'ELI 25 - Auto Created' --save
```

## Using the samples and making your life even more lazier

## Using AI for getting the documentation

We have infused Mendable AI within our docs. So if you are not sure how to use a command, you can use the help of our AI assistant Chili to get the documentation.

```bash
alias "m365?"="m365_chili"
```

Once it is setup you can try the following in your command

```bash
m365? "Please give me the command to Create SharePoint list"
```
